"""The provenance identity check, shown refusing before it is trusted.

    python3 .github/release/provenance-arms.py --foreign <provenance.json> \\
        --repository <owner>/<repo> --workflow <file> --environment <name> \\
        --work <directory>

Run by the `identity` job in `.github/workflows/publish.yml`, which the upload
jobs need, and by hand the same way. `--foreign` is a provenance an index
really stored for a file some OTHER publisher uploaded: the job fetches one of
`dagster-dex`'s from pypi.org. The other three name the publisher the upload
jobs expect.

Each arm is a provenance written into `--work`, handed to
`check-provenance.py` exactly as the upload jobs call it, and decided by its
exit code. The foreign provenance is refused as fetched. Every arm that
writes a provenance derives it from the foreign one, so each has the shape an
index really answers. The admitted arm is the foreign one with its publisher
rewritten to the expected one, and it is what shows the refusals are refusals
of a publisher, not of a shape the checker cannot read. Most refusing arms
change one field of the admitted publisher; two put another publisher's bundle
beside the expected one, in each order, so a checker that reads one bundle is
refused whichever it reads; two remove what an index might answer with (the
bundles, an attestation); two hand over no provenance at all; and one omits
`--environment` alone, so a checker that defaults it is refused.

Before any arm, a positive control: the foreign provenance holds at least one
bundle, each with at least one attestation, and names another repository, so
its refusal is a refusal of the publisher.
