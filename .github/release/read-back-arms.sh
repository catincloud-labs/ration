# read-back.sh, shown refusing before an upload job trusts it.
#
#   bash .github/release/read-back-arms.sh
#
# Run by the `identity` job in .github/workflows/publish.yml, and by hand the
# same way. read-back.sh runs only after an upload, when a version is already
# spent, so this runs it on every pull request against files another publisher
# really uploaded: `dagster-dex` 1.1.0 on pypi.org, whose digests are read
# from pypi.org's JSON API first.
#
# read-back.sh exits 0 or 1, so each arm is decided by its exit code AND by
# what its output attributes the outcome to, because two different causes
# give the same exit 1:
#
#   refused   expecting this repository's publisher: exit 1, each file's
#             provenance "refused with 5", and the digests agreeing
#   digest    expecting dagster-dex's own publisher, with one digest changed:
#             exit 1, each provenance "admitted", and the digest comparison red
#   admitted  expecting dagster-dex's own publisher and its real digests:
#             exit 0, last, so it is read only after both refusals were seen
#
# Read from the environment: PUBLISHER_REPOSITORY and PUBLISHER_WORKFLOW, the
# publisher the upload jobs expect, as publish.yml sets them.
