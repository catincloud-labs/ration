# Read back from an index what an upload job of .github/workflows/publish.yml
# just uploaded: each file's provenance, judged by check-provenance.py against
# the publisher the job expects, and the digest the index reports for each
# file, compared with the one the `build` job reported.
#
#   bash .github/release/read-back.sh
#
# Read from the environment, as the upload jobs set it:
#   INDEX                 https://pypi.org or https://test.pypi.org
#   ENVIRONMENT           pypi or testpypi, the job's environment
#   PROJECT               the distribution name
#   VERSION               the version uploaded
#   SUMS                  `sha256sum` lines for the files, from `build`
#   PUBLISHER_REPOSITORY  the repository the publisher must name
#   PUBLISHER_WORKFLOW    the workflow file the publisher must name
#
# By the time this runs the version is on the index and nothing here can take
# it off, so a red exit is the report that it did not read back as expected.
# The integrity and JSON APIs can lag an upload, so each read is retried a
# bounded number of times; after that an absence is real.
#
#   0   every file's provenance names the expected publisher, and the index
#       reports the digest `build` reported for every file and no other file
#   1   anything else; each cause is printed as an error
